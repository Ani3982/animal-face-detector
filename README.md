🐾 Animal Face Detector – Project Overview
🔹 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify animal faces into different categories (e.g., dog, cat, panda, etc.) using deep learning and computer vision.

🔹 Workflow

Dataset Preparation

You collected animal face images and organized them into folders (one folder per class, e.g., cat/, dog/, panda/).

Each image is resized to 224×224 pixels to match the input requirements of MobileNetV2.

Feature Extraction (Transfer Learning)

You used MobileNetV2 (a lightweight CNN pre-trained on ImageNet) as a feature extractor.

Instead of training a CNN from scratch, MobileNetV2 provides powerful pre-trained features.

This saves time, reduces training cost, and improves accuracy with limited data.

Model Architecture

Base Model: MobileNetV2 (frozen, not trained).

Added layers:

Dense(256, ReLU) → for learning dataset-specific patterns.

Dense(#classes, Softmax) → final classification layer.

Training

The dataset is split into train (80%) and test (20%) sets.

Model is trained using:

Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.0005.

Sparse categorical crossentropy loss.

Accuracy metric.

Trained for 10 epochs.

Saving Model & Encoder

Trained model saved as animal_classifier.h5.

Label encoder (to map numeric class IDs ↔ actual class names) saved as label_encoder.pkl.

Prediction

Model predicts the animal face class for new images.

With OpenCV (cv2), you added a real-time webcam detector:

Captures frames from your camera.

Preprocesses each frame.

Classifies the animal face.

Displays prediction + confidence on screen.

🔹 Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning Framework)

scikit-learn (Label Encoding, train/test split)

OpenCV (Real-time webcam detection)

NumPy (Data handling)

Joblib (Saving encoder)

🔹 Key Features

✅ Uses transfer learning (MobileNetV2).
✅ Works on custom animal dataset.
✅ Real-time animal face classification via webcam.
✅ Saves trained model for future use (no need to retrain).

🔹 Possible Improvements

Add data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom) to make the model more robust.

Use fine-tuning (unfreeze some MobileNetV2 layers) for higher accuracy.

Add bounding box detection (using YOLO, SSD, or Haar cascades) → detect and classify animal faces, not just classify whole images.

Deploy as a Flask/Django web app or a mobile app.

📌 In short:
Your project builds an AI-powered animal face classifier using deep learning, which can recognize different animals from images and even in live webcam feed.
